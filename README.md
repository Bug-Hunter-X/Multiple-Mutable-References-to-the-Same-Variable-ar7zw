This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates a potential issue with multiple mutable references to the same variable within the same scope.  The program uses two mutable references (`y` and `z`) to the same variable `x`.  Modifying `x` through one reference affects the value seen through the other, highlighting the need for careful management of mutable references to prevent unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this by using appropriate ownership and borrowing patterns.
